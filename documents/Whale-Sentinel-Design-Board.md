## Security

### Application

Implementing Language-theoretic Security (LangSec) in application development involves designing input-handling routines as formal language recognizers, ensuring that all inputs are strictly validated and parsed according to well-defined grammars, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities and enhancing overall security.

- All data is validated at both the frontend and backend.
  - Text input / output
    - All data is validated at both the frontend and backend, and special characters are filtered and removed. ``!` @ # $ % ^ & * () - _ = + { } [ ] | \ : ; " ' < > , . ? / ~ \``
    - Use prepared statements (also known as parameterized queries) to prevent SQL Injection.
    - Ensure data is encoded before it is sent back to the application.
    - Do not display detailed error messages in the application. Instead, show a general error message or redirect users to an error page.
    - Masking sensitive information, such as passwords and personally identifiable information (PII).
  - File upload
    - Whitelist file extensions (e.g., pdf, png, jpg, etc.).
    - Check the end of the file name string against the whitelist to validate the file extension.
    - Check the metadata header of the file to validate the file type.
    - Check the file size does not exceed 25MB.
    - Create a random name for the file before saving it.
    - Save the file to the specified directory.
-  Check authentication and authorization before performing any action.
-  Use the GET method to retrieve data and the POST method to update data.

### Network 

- By default, deny all connections. Allow connections only when needed.
- All connections are encrypted in transit using HTTPS and at least TLS 1.2 for secure communication.
- Use SFTP with TLS 1.2 or above for file transfers.

### Data

- Classify and label sensitive information, such as passwords and personally identifiable information (PII).
- Enable data encryption features when storing data on AWS services such as RDS, S3, ElastiCache, ..., or other cloud services.
- Encrypt all backup data.

### Cryptography

- Implement strong cryptographic practices.
  - Strong Hash Algorithms : SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2, BLAKE2.
  - Strong Encryption Algorithms : AES 256/GCM/NoPadding, RSA 2048, ECC.
- Use AES256 to encryption E2E message with sensitve data when transfer.
- Use PGP to encryption file when tranfer.
- Use SHA256withRSA for request signing.
- Use JWT with RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256) for REST API authentication with a secret key length of 2048 bits or RSA 2048 for public and private keys.
- Follow the X.509 Version 3 Certificate format for certificates.
