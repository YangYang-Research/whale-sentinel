# Whale Sentinel Security Feature  

## Deep Learning Model Web Attack Detection

The Whale Sentinel Security system leverages advanced **Deep Learning Models** to detect and mitigate various types of cyberattacks in real time. By continuously analyzing web traffic patterns, request payloads, and user behaviors, the system enhances security against sophisticated threats.  

### **Threats Detected by the Deep Learning Model:**  

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  
   - Detects and blocks attempts to inject malicious JavaScript into web applications, preventing data theft and session hijacking.  

2. **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  
   - Identifies attempts to manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access, extract sensitive information, or modify database content.  

3. **Path Traversal (Local File Inclusion - LFI):**  
   - Prevents attackers from accessing restricted directories and reading arbitrary files on the server.  

4. **Command Injection:**  
   - Detects and mitigates attempts to execute unauthorized system commands through vulnerable input fields.  

5. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  
   - Blocks attempts to inject and execute malicious remote scripts on the server, preventing unauthorized control over the application.  

6. **JSON & XML Injection:**  
   - Analyzes JSON and XML payloads to detect data manipulation attacks targeting API endpoints and web services.  

7. **HTML5 Injection:**  
   - Identifies and prevents the exploitation of HTML5 features for security breaches, such as form tampering and unauthorized content rendering.  

8. **Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection:**  
   - Protects against unauthorized execution of server-side scripts that can expose sensitive data or compromise system integrity.
